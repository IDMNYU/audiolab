# Research

At the IDM Audio Lab, we do a lot of research around synthesizers and other topics related to the design research of music technology.

- [synthaccess](https://github.com/IDMNYU/synthaccess/) : a set of related projects around synthesizer accessibility.
- [p5.func](https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-func/) : a library extension for the p5.js system around function generators.
- [p5.speech](https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/) : a library extension for the p5.js system around speech synthesis and recognition.
