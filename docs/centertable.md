The center table is home to all of the non-modular synthesizers in the lab.  These are [analog synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer) in various styles that follow the tradition of ["East Coast"](https://reverb.com/news/the-basics-of-east-coast-and-west-coast-synthesis) synthesis design, where the format for control of pitches are based on Western scales, often using a piano-esque layout.  These synths often focus on subtractive synthesis techniques where simple, richer waveforms like sawtooth and square waves, are carved away using filters to create custom sounds.  

## Roland SH-101

The [Roland SH-101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_SH-101) is a monophonic [analog synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer).  It was produced from 1982-1986, and released in the US at $495 USD. Although originally designed to be paired with a keytar attachment, the low entry cost, small size, and easily accessible sequencer and arpeggiator led it to become a staple in the electronic house music scene of the 90s.  

The single voice the SH-101 produces can be mixed as a combination of a square wave, sawtooth wave, random, noise, and sub oscillators. There is an onboard envelope for the oscillators, and an LFO that can be controlled internally or externally to modulate various parameters. 

A scan of the original user manual can be found [here](http://dl.lojinx.com/analoghell/RolandSH101-OwnersManual.pdf).

The Roland SH-101 is:
- [**Monophonic / monotimbral**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony_and_monophony_in_instruments#Monophonic) : the ARP 2600 was designed to be played with a keyboard controller or the 1601 sequencer, one note at a time, with each note making the same kind of "sound," or timbre. However, with a little bit of work, you can re-patch an ARP to leverage the four sound sources independently of one another to create more than one sound at a time.
- **Voltage-based** : like most modular synthesizers of the day, the SH-101 uses voltage for both transmitting [analog audio signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal) (e.g. the sound coming from the oscillators) and [control voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV/Gate) to modify parameters of the synthesizer. These signals are *both* carried over dual-conductor wiring either internally within the synth or externally via "TS" patch cables. This allows you to treat audio signals as control voltage when using the synthesizer so that, for example, an oscillator can be used to "sweep" the cutoff frequency of a filter. The downside of this is that *you can accidentally patch a control voltage line into the signal path to the speakers*, which can damage both the speakers and your ears.
- **Subtractive** : the SH-101 makes sound based on the principles of [*subtractive synthesis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis) - the oscillators create waveforms rich in harmonic content which are then shaped by the filters and amplifiers. This is in contrast to [*additive* synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) where simple waveforms (e.g. sine waves) are combined to make complex tones. Subtractive synthesis, along with a default (keyboard-oriented) wiring pathway, is part of what makes the SH-101 a classic [*"East Coast"*](https://reverb.com/news/the-basics-of-east-coast-and-west-coast-synthesis) synthesizer.
- **Single source / single destination** : the single voice composed of the onboard oscillators only one patch point for the module's output. With this synthesizer, the single onboard filter is used to modify the signal combined through the mixer module.
- **Standalone and wearable design** : the SH-101 was intended to be used either as a wearable keytar instrument, where one could attach a short neck and strap to carry the synth around stage with a built in battery.  We do not have the external gear in the lab, but feel free to lie on your side next to the synth and pretend!

### The Modules
<img src = "./img/sh101.jpeg" width="100%" title="Roland SH-101" alt="Roland SH-101">

Here we will walk through the modules from left to right, top to bottom.

The first knob in the top left is labelled "TUNE", which allows you to finely control the overall pitching of the synthesizer Â±1 semitone.  This is particularly useful when trying to get the synthesizer to be "in tune" with other instruments or sound sources.

The next module is titled "MODULATOR", containing an "LFO/ CLICK RATE" slider and a "WAVE FORM" knob.  The slider controls the speed of the LFO for modulators and the internal clock for the arpeggiator and sequencer, while the knob controls which internal oscillator is being sounded between a square wave, sawtooth wave, random, and noise.

The third module is "VCO", which contains a "MOD" slider, "RANGE" knob, "PULSE WIDTH" slider, and a small switch next to that.  The "MOD" slider controls how much the previous module's LFO controls the oscillator.  It can be thought of as depth, or as wet/dry control of the "MODULATOR" module over the oscillator.  The "RANGE" knob controls the octave that the synthesizer plays within.  The markings on this knob are delineated in feet, which is based on the custom of doubling the length of pipes in a pipe organ syncing up to lowering an octave, and vice versa.  The ["PULSE WIDTH"](https://www.keithmcmillen.com/blog/simple-synthesis-part-6-pulse-width-modulation/) slider controls the duty cycle of the square wave oscillator.  The small switch on the side decides whether you want the pulse modulation to be controlled via the LFO, through manual modulation, or using the envelope as a modulator.
