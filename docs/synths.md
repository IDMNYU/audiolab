# Overview

![Analog Studio Panorama](./img/analog_overview.jpg "Analog Studio Panorama")

IDM has a collection of analog synthesizers for the users of the Audio Lab to work with, set up as a self-contained studio in the corner of the room. These include:

- a large [Serge modular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_synthesizer) built for IDM by [Patch Point](https://www.patch-point.com/) in Berlin, based on PCBs designed by [Random Source](http://randomsource.net/).
- a smaller Serge modular system built by [Luther Bradfute](https://www.lbradfute.com/) in Tennessee based on the [73-75](http://www.73-75.com/) modular system designed by [The Human Comparator](http://www.thehumancomparator.net/) in Stockholm.
- the [Shelfisizer](https://github.com/IDMNYU/shelfisizer), a set of Arduino-based Serge modules designed by Luke.

In addition, a number of additional bits and pieces exist in the Audio Lab to help people work with the synthesizers:
- A [Behringer UFX-1204](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog/UFX1204/p/P0AB2) Mixer with USB output for recording.
- A [MOTU 8A](https://motu.com/products/avb/8a) DC-coupled Audio Interface with a custom-built banana-jack patchbay.
- A [MOTU Micro Express](https://motu.com/products/midi/micro_usb) MIDI interface.
- A vintage [IVL Pitchrider 4000](https://www.ivlaudio.com/home) pitch-to-MIDI converter.
- A [CV.OCD](https://six4pix.net/product/cvocd/) MIDI-to-Control Voltage converter.
- Multiple [Low Gain Electronics](http://lowgain-audio.com/) passive converter boxes.
- Three vintage [B&K oscilloscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope_history) - two model 1470s, one model 1479B.
- Stereo Genelec speakers.

# Studio Basics

### Power

The power for *everything* in the analog studio is controled by a single switch, found on the Furman power conditioner on the black rack to the right:
![Furman Power Conditioner](./img/analogpower.jpg "Furman Power Conditioner")
A green light on the conditioner will confirm that you've got power.
**Please use this power switch (and nothing else) to turn on and off all the equipment in the analog studio.**

### Mixer

The mixer for the analog studio is a Behringer UFX-1204, which takes inputs from the various synthesizers and feeds them to the speakers or, by using a USB connector, to your computer for recording.
