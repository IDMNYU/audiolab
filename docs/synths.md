# The Analog Synthesizers

## Overview

IDM has a collection of analog synthesizers for the users of the Audio Lab to work with. These include:

- a large Serge modular system built by [Patch Point](https://www.patch-point.com/) in Berlin based on designs published by [Random Source](http://randomsource.net/).
- smaller Serge modular system built by [Luther Bradfute](https://www.lbradfute.com/) in Tennessee based on the [73-75](http://www.73-75.com/) designed by [The Human Comparator](http://www.thehumancomparator.net/) in Stockholm.
- the [Shelfisizer](https://github.com/IDMNYU/shelfisizer) a set of Arduino-based Serge modules designed by Luke.

In addition, a number of additional bits and pieces exist in the Audio Lab to help people work with the synthesizers:
- A [Behringer UFX-1204](https://www.behringer.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog/UFX1204/p/P0AB2#googtrans(en|en)) Mixer with USB output for recording.
- A [MOTU 8A](https://motu.com/products/avb/8a) DC-coupled Audio Interface with a custom-built banana-jack patchbay.
- A [MOTU Micro Express](https://motu.com/products/midi/micro_usb) MIDI interface.
- A vintage IVL Pitchrider 4000 pitch-to-MIDI converter.
- A [CV.OCD](https://six4pix.net/product/cvocd/) MIDI-to-Control Voltage converter.
- Multiple [Low Gain Electronics](http://lowgain-audio.com/) passive converter boxes.
- Three vintage B&K oscilloscopes - two model 1470s, one model 1479B.
- Stereo speakers.
