The Peavey power switch is on the front panel; the Fender power switch is on the back. **Please remember to turn off the amplifiers when you are done using them.**

Both amps have pedalboards, curated to use for baseline instrument effects research with the [IDM Pedals](https://idmnyu.github.io/IDMPEDALS/) project.

The bass pedalboard consists of (from right to left):
