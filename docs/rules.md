# IDM Audio Lab - READ THIS FIRST

## Lab Policies

*What the Audio Lab is:*

The IDM Audio Lab is **for the use of IDM faculty, students, staff, and guests working in sound**, whether for class assignments, sponsored research, or on their own creative projects. It is a shared space with a lot of different uses...

- Analog synthesizer studio
- Audio research lab
- Sound electronics workshop
- Multi-channel audio room
- Audio recording studio

...each of which is supported by different equipment.

*What the Audio Lab is not:*

The IDM Audio Lab is **not a commercial recording studio**. Under no circumstances can you bring clients in to record and then charge them money.

The Audio Lab is **not a social space**. If you're not working with the equipment, please find another place to hang out so that other folks can come in and work.

## Lab Rules

All Audio Lab users will have to watch a training video and take a short quiz. (Link TBA).

*Please observe the following rules while working in the Audio Lab*

- The Audio Lab is a **shared space**. Please be respectful of other people's equipment and work that might be ongoing, and wear a mask at all times. If you need to set up additional equipment, please work with the IDM staff to install it safely and make sure it's clearly got your name on it.
- If you don't know how to use a particular setup and the directions aren't clear, **don't wing it**. Ask the audio GRA or one of the IDM faculty or staff for help.
- **No eating or drinking** in the room. The rest of the 8th floor of 2MTC is an open space where you can eat and drink all you want.
- **Don't ever leave the door propped open**, even if you run out for a minute. The 8th floor of 2MTC is used by the entire NYU community, and the Audio Lab has a lot of expensive equipment in it for use by the IDM program.

*Please observe the following rules when you're leaving the Audio Lab*

- Clean up after you're done.
- Turn the power off (**only on the power conditioners, instrument amps, analog tape deck, and oscilloscopes**) for the gear you've used.
- Leave things so that they're ready for the next person. For the analog synthesizers, take your patch down and store your cables back in the rack; for the center table, normalize the mixing board.
- Turn the lights off when you leave (switches are by the door), including the faerie lights and spots in the main lab (the switch is against the back wall by the synthesizers).
- Make sure the door is closed and locked when you leave.
- Make sure any equipment you've checked out gets returned to the IDM Equipment Room over in 370 Jay Street.

## Room Reservation Procedure

Users of the Audio Lab need to be either enrolled in a course that uses the studio, be part of the synth club, or be working on a capstone / thesis project related to sound, with access approved by Luke and Eric. Students in courses and the Synth Club will have a shared weekly block of time to work in the lab - their instructor will tell them how to schedule their hours. Other users must be invited to the IDM [Skedda Calendar](https://idmnyu.skedda.com/booking) to reserve time. The main studio (824) and control room (823) are independently reservable in half-hour blocks during 2MTC operating hours.

Students in IDM audio courses can reserve up to **4 hours per week** in the Audio Lab, with a 2-hour maximum booking for any given time.

Students in the analog synth club can reserve up to **2 hours per week** in the Audio Lab beyond the regularly scheduled club time.

Card access for the IDM Audio Lab is automatically granted for students in IDM audio courses and in the synth club. 

Other students interested in working in the room (e.g. for capstone or thesis work) must be approved to do so by Luke and Eric.
