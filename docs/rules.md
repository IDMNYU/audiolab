## Policies

*What the Audio Lab is*

The IDM Audio lab is for the  use of IDM faculty, students, staff, and guests working in sound, for class assignments, sponsored research, or on their own creative projects. It is a shared space with a lot of different uses...

- Audio recording Suite
- Multi-channel Audio Room
- Analog Synthesizer Studio
- Audio Research Lab
- Sound Electronics Workshop

...each of which is supported by different equipment.

*What the Audio Lab is not*

The Audio Lab is not a commercial recording studio. Under no circumstances can you bring clients in to record and then charge them money.

The Audio Lab is not a social space. If you're not working with the equipment, please find another space so that other folks can come in and work.

## Rules

*Please observe the following rules in the Audio Lab*

- No eating or drinking in the room. The rest of the 8th floor of 2MTC is an open space where you can eat and drink all you want.
- Turn the lights off when you leave (switches are by the door), including the fairie lights and spots in the main lab (the switch is against the back wall by the synthesizers).
- Make sure the door is closed and locked when you leave, and don't leave it propped open if you run out for a minute. The 8th floor of 2MTC is used by the entire NYU community, and the Audio Lab has a lot of expensive equipment in it for use by the IDM program.
